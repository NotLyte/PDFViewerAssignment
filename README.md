# PDFViewerAssignment

## About

This is a work assignment to build a multi-tab PDF Viewer windows application using PDFTron's UWP SDK.

## Features

- Open and view PDF documents, and attempts to convert MS Office documents to PDFs for viewing.

## Build and Compile

- The project needs to be re-built then compiled to update NuGet packages.

## Using the app

- Adding tabs, then open files with the button from the command bar underneath the tab.

## Known issues

- Conversion does not always work if the file contains fonts that are not supported, or maybe I missed something.
- Files seems to be "locked" for a period of time after opening them, perhaps improvements can be made here.
